Excel spreadsheet to manage fantasy football auctions and squads.

## Sheets
1. I: Summer auction session sheet.
2. Ia: Session of team corrections after summer football market stops. [HIDDEN]
3. II: Post-summer session sheet (possible after summer corrections and winter auction).
4. PLAYERS: List of players up-to-date (therefore must be updated before each auction)
5. SVINCOLI: List of players both sold and present after winter football market

## What to do 
- Open the file.
- IF SUMMER AUCTION: Update the entire 'PLAYERS' sheet and then update 'PLAYERS' range in 'PLAYERS' sheet; then start with the auction in sheet 'I';
- OTHERWISE: Update the entire 'PLAYERS' sheet and then update 'PLAYERS' range in 'PLAYERS' sheet; then update the entire 'SVINCOLI' sheet with all players, also the sold ones; then start with the auction/correction in sheet 'II'
